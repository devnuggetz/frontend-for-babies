For example, when you're programming, you sometimes want to do two things at the same time. However, the computer can only do one thing at a time. By using promises, you can tell the computer to do one task, then do another task after the first one is complete. \n\nIn summary, promises in Javascript are like special rules that you can give to the computer.

This means that you can have some secret code that only you know about and no one else can see or change it.\n\nLet's say for example you're making a game for your 5 year old. You want to make sure that no one else can see the code for that game, so you can use a closure. This will keep the code secret and no one else can tamper with it.\n\nTo use a closure in Javascript, you create a function that \"closes\" or wraps the code you want to keep secret. Then, that function is the only way to access the code inside. Any time you want to get to the code, you can call the function and it will show you what's inside.\n\nLet's say you're creating a game with a magic spell. The code for the spell is inside the closure, and it's the only way to access that code. So, if someone else wants to use your spell, they have to call the function that holds the code.\n\nClosures in Javascript can be really handy when you have code you want to keep private but still make it accessible to others.

It takes the information on a web page and organizes it like a library with books and chapters. The information is broken up into small pieces, or objects, such as text, images, and videos. This makes it easier for computers to understand the information on the page.\n\nFor example, when you visit a web page, your computer reads the information on the page, like the text and images, and organizes it into DOM objects. That way, when you click on something on the page, like a link or button, your computer knows exactly what to do. It can instantly find the link you clicked on and navigate to the new web page.\n\nIn this way, DOM helps computers understand the web so that we can easily navigate from page to page.

For example, a grocery list might have apples, oranges, and bananas, and the values might be 3, 10, and 5, meaning you want to buy 3 apples, 10 oranges, and 5 bananas. The same thing works in JSON. Instead of saying "apples" and "oranges", it might say "name" and "age". The values would still be 3, 10, and 5, but they would represent a person\'s name and age.\n\nJSON lets computers quickly and easily exchange information. It is like when a teacher gives out assignments to her students, and each student turns them in. The students are exchanging information with their teacher. JSON is like that, but it is for computers.\n\nJSON can be used for a lot of different things. It is used for sending and receiving data over the internet, like when you watch a video on YouTube.

Now imagine that you want to create a new type of block, like a blue block with a window. It would be a lot of work to build this block from scratch, so instead you can use an existing block as a starting point. \n\nIn Javascript, this same concept applies. Instead of starting from scratch each time, we can create a new object by taking an existing object and adding to it. This is called \"prototypal inheritance\". \n\nFor example, let's say we have a Person object. This Person object has certain traits, like a name, age, and gender. We could create a new object called Student by taking the Person object and adding new traits, like student number and grade. \n\nLet's look at an example of prototypal inheritance in action. \n\n// Create a Person object \nlet Person = { \n  name: 'John', \n  age: 30, \n  gender: 'male' \n}; \n\n// Create a Student object \nlet Student = Object.create(Person); \nStudent.studentNumber = 12345; \nStudent.grade = 'A'; \n\nNow we have a Student object that has all the traits of the Person object, plus two more traits of its own. \n\nPrototypal inheritance is a great way to save time and energy when creating new objects.

They should also learn to be aware of where they are going online and make sure that they are visiting websites they know and trust. \n\nFinally, it is important to remember that XSS is not something that only happens to adults. Kids can also be the victim of XSS attacks. By knowing what to look out for and how to protect themselves, children can help keep themselves safe online.",

    term: "Polymorphism in Javascript",
    data: "\nPolymorphism is a fancy word that means something different depending on the situation. In programming, polymorphism is a way of writing code that lets different objects or pieces of code work together in different ways.\n\nTo explain it to a 5 year old, let's use an example. Suppose you have two friends, Jack and Jill. They both like to play games. Jack likes to play board games like chess and checkers. Jill likes to play video games like Super Mario and Pokemon. \n\nJack and Jill are like two different pieces of code. They both like to play games, but they do it in different ways. That's polymorphism.\n\nIn programming, polymorphism is used to combine different pieces of code and make them work together. It helps programmers make complex programs easier to understand and manage.\n\nFor example, if you're making a game that has both board games and video games, you can use polymorphism to make sure both types of games work together. The code for Jack and Jill will be written in different ways, but it will still work together to make the game work.\n\nPolymorphism is a powerful tool in programming that helps make complex programs easier to understand and manage. It helps us write code that is flexible enough to work with different kinds of objects and pieces of code.",

    term: "SOLID design principle",
    data: '\nSOLID is a set of five principles that help us build better programs. It\'s like a set of rules that we use when we\'re writing code so that it works well and it\'s easy to change and update. \n\nThe first letter stands for "Single Responsibility Principle". That means that each part of the program should do just one thing. A five year old can think of this like organizing their toys. For example, if they want to play with their Lego set, they shouldn\'t look for the pieces in the kitchen; they should look in the toy box. \n\nThe next letter is O for "Open-Closed Principle". This means that if we want to change a program, we can do it without breaking the whole program. A five year old can think of this like when they change their clothes. They can take off one shirt and put on another, but the body they have still stays the same. \n\nThe third letter is L for "Liskov Substitution Principle". This means that if a program is written correctly, we can use parts of it in other programs without breaking it. A five year old can think of this like when they build a tower with blocks. They can substitute a big block for a small one as long as the tower doesn\'t collapse. \n\nThe fourth letter is I for "Interface Segregation Principle". This means that programs should be broken down into small pieces that can be used separately. A five year old can think of this like when they put together a puzzle. They can work on small sections of the puzzle at a time, and when they\'re done, the entire puzzle is finished. \n\nThe last letter is D for "Dependency Inversion Principle". This means that if we want to change a program, we can do it without breaking the parts that are connected to it. A five year old can think of this like when they build a train track. They can add new tracks and take away old ones without making the whole train track stop working. \n\nSo that\'s SOLID — a set of five principles that help us write better programs. When we use it, our programs work better, are easier to change, and don\'t break when we update them.',

    term: "Coercion in JavaScript",
    data: "\nCoercion in JavaScript is a way of changing the type of a value from one type to another, such as from a string to a number. It's like when you turn a piece of paper from one shape to another, like from a square to a triangle.\n\nIn JavaScript, coercion is used a lot to make sure that the code is working in the way it is supposed to work. For example, when you want to add two numbers together, you want to make sure that both numbers are actually numbers, and not strings. So if one of the numbers is a string, the JavaScript will try to 'coerce' it into a number.\n\nIt's like you are trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. The JavaScript will try to 'shape' the string into a number so that it fits into the equation.\n\nLet's say you have a 5 year old and you have the number '5' written down on a piece of paper. But your 5 year old wants to add it to another number, such as 8. If you give the '5' to your 5 year old as is, it won't work. Your 5 year old needs to understand that it needs to be changed into a number for it to work. That's what coercion does in JavaScript.\n\nCoercion can be helpful, but it can also be dangerous, so you have to be careful when using it. For instance, if you try to add a number to a string, the result may not be what you expect. For example, if you try to add the number 5 to the string 'hello', the result will be '5hello'.\n\nSo it's important to understand coercion and make sure that it's used correctly. Coercion can be a powerful tool, but it can also lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly.",

    term: "IIFEs",
    data: '\nAn IIFE stands for "Immediately Invoked Function Expression." It is a type of function that is executed as soon as it is created. It is like a surprise present that you open immediately!\n\nTo make an IIFE, we start with the word "function". Then, we use parentheses and put some code inside. Finally, after the parentheses, we add two more parentheses. This makes a special type of function that runs right away.\n\nNow, why do we use IIFEs? Well, if we have some code that we don\'t want anyone else to see, we can put it in an IIFE. That way, it will be hidden and won\'t affect the rest of our program. We can also use IIFEs to help us keep our code clean and organized. They can help us keep our code organized by grouping related code together so that it is easy to find.\n\nAnother reason to use IIFEs is to make sure that our code is run in the right order. With an IIFE, we can make sure that certain code only runs after other code has already been run. This can help us avoid mistakes and bugs in our program.\n\nFinally, IIFEs can be used to help us keep variables and functions separate from the rest of our program. This can help us avoid conflicts between different parts of our program.\n\nSo, IIFEs are like surprise presents that can help us keep our code clean and organized. They can also help us make sure that our code runs in the right order, and they can help us keep variables and functions separate from the rest of our program.',
