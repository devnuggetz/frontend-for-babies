        Browser is a special program on your computer that helps you find and
        look at websites. Websites are like big online books that have lots of
        different stories and pictures. Browsers look for websites on the
        Internet so you can look at them. The Internet is like a big library
        that has lots of books in it, and the browser helps you find the one you
        want. When you want to look at a website, you type its address into the
        browser. This is like finding a book in a library. You can also ask the
        browser to show you websites about whatever you want. To do this, you
        type some words into the browser that describe what you're looking for.
        Then the browser will show you a list of websites that might have what
        you're looking for. You can then pick one of the websites to look at.
        Browsers also help you save websites so you can look at them later. They
        also help you remember your passwords, so you don't have to type them in
        every time you want to look at a website. Browsers also help keep you
        safe. They can block websites that might have bad things in them or
        things that could hurt your computer. That's what a browser is, and it's
        really helpful for looking at websites on the Internet.

      <div>
        The useContext hook is a special type of hook in React that helps you
        share information between different parts of your app. It's like a
        little bridge that lets different parts of your app talk to each other.
        Imagine you have a game where you want to keep track of your score. You
        can use the useContext hook to create a “score bridge” so that your
        score is shared between all the different parts of the game. For
        example, if you get a point in one part of the game, it will instantly
        show up in all the other parts of the game. The useContext hook is like
        a box that stores information. You can tell it what kind of information
        it should store, like a score or a list of names, and then it will keep
        track of that information. You can also tell it to change the
        information, like if you want to add or subtract points from the score.
        To use the useContext hook, you need to create a context object. This
        object is like a box that you can tell your app to store information in.
        You can also tell the context object to change the information when
        needed. Once you have a context object, you can use the useContext hook
        to access the information stored in the box. This is the bridge between
        different parts of your app. You can use the information from the
        context object to show the score in one part of the game, and you can
        use the same information to change the score in a different part of the
        game. So when you're playing your game and you score a point, the
        useContext hook is like a bridge that instantly updates the score in all
        the other parts of the game. Pretty cool, huh?

        Redux is a way of organizing data in a computer program. It helps keep
        track of all the pieces of information in the program and makes sure
        that each piece is in the correct place. Imagine that a computer program
        is like a big house, with lots of rooms and objects in each room. Redux
        helps to make sure that each room is in the correct place and that all
        the objects in the house are organised. Redux works by creating a place
        to store data from the computer program. This place is called a “store”.
        In the store, all the pieces of information from the program can be
        stored, like the type of furniture in each room. Redux helps to make
        sure that the right type of furniture is in the right place. When the
        program needs to do something with the data, like move a piece of
        furniture from one room to another, it sends an “action” to the store.
        The action tells Redux what needs to be done with the data. Redux then
        figures out how to do the action, like how to move the furniture, and
        makes sure that the data is organized correctly. Redux helps to make
        sure that the data in the program is always organized correctly and that
        the right pieces of information are in the right place. That way, the
        program can work properly and do all the things it needs to do.

      <div>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a special code that is
        used to create websites and webpages. As a 5 year old, you may not know
        what that means, so let me explain. A webpage is like a book. It is made
        up of words and images that tell a story. HTML is like a special
        language that is used to tell the computer what the words and images
        should be and how they should look. It's like a set of instructions that
        tell the computer what to do. For example, HTML can tell the computer to
        make the words on the page big or small. It can also tell the computer
        to add a picture or a video to a page. HTML can even help the computer
        to know where to put the links on a page. HTML is like a magic code that
        helps the computer know what to do. Without it, you would never be able
        to look at a webpage or read a website. HTML is like a secret language,
        and it helps the computer make all the amazing things that you can find
        on the internet.

        CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". It is a style sheet language
        used to describe how a website looks. It is used to make websites look
        more attractive and to make them easier to use. CSS helps create the
        look and feel of a website. It can tell the website how to display
        images, how to make text look, how to position things on the page, and
        more. It can also improve the usability of a website by making it easier
        to navigate and find what you're looking for. Think of CSS like a
        coloring book. You can decide which colors you want to use and where you
        want to use them. In the same way, you can choose what fonts and colors
        you want to use on your website and where you want them to go. It's also
        like building blocks. You can use blocks of code to build a website,
        like a tower. The blocks are like the building blocks and you can use
        them to create a great looking website. Finally, CSS is also like an
        orchestra. You can choose which instruments to use and where to put
        them. Each instrument is like a piece of code and together they can
        create a sound that's beautiful. So, CSS is how we make websites look
        and work great!

    term: "Javascript",
    explain: (
      <div>
        Javascript is a type of computer language that helps people make
        websites on the internet. It tells the computer how to show words,
        images, and movies on the page, and what to do when someone clicks on or
        types something. Think of it like this: when you play a board game, the
        cards and pieces tell you what to do and how to move. Javascript works
        the same way, but it's like an invisible game-master that tells the
        computer what to do when someone visits a website. Javascript also helps
        websites do things like remember who you are when you come back, or show
        different pictures depending on the time of day. Because Javascript
        works so fast, it can do things like check if you spelled something
        wrong before you submit it, or show you a special message if it's your
        birthday. Without Javascript, websites would be much harder to use. For
        a five-year-old, the best way to explain Javascript would be to use an
        everyday example. For instance, when you play with your toys, you tell
        the toys what to do, like to fly or run, and they do it. Javascript
        works in a similar way; it tells the computer what to do, like show
        words and pictures or save information, and then the computer does it.
        It's like a magical language that helps websites work the way they do.
