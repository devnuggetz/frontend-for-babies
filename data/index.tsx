For example, when you're programming, you sometimes want to do two things at the same time. However, the computer can only do one thing at a time. By using promises, you can tell the computer to do one task, then do another task after the first one is complete. \n\nIn summary, promises in Javascript are like special rules that you can give to the computer.

You use it to create lots of objects that have the same properties, or information. \n\nLet's say you wanted to create a game character that was a superhero. You might use a constructor to create an object that contains the superhero's name, age, and superpower. You could give the constructor the information for your superhero, like its name and age, and then it would create an object with that information inside it. \n\nConstructors are very useful for creating objects in Javascript. They make it easy to create lots of objects that all have the same properties. So, if you wanted to create a game with lots of superheroes, using a constructor would be a great way to do it!",

    data: "\nJquery is a computer language that helps people to use the internet faster and easier. It's a programming language that helps website designers to quickly create websites and applications that look great and run smoothly. It's like a big toolbox that website designers can use to quickly make a website or application look good.\n\nJquery helps website designers make websites faster and easier. It helps them use some of the same tools and features, so they don't need to start all over every time they want to make a website. For example, if you wanted to make a website that had different colored boxes all over it, you could use Jquery. Jquery would help you quickly create those boxes, so you don't have to spend a long time writing code. \n\nJquery also helps website designers make websites and applications look better. For example, it can help them make things look more interesting by adding animations or making things move. It also helps them make websites look more organized, with elements that look like they belong together. \n\nJquery is also used to make websites easier to use.

    term: "Async/Defer",
    data: "\nAsync and Defer are two words that describe a way that computers can load information faster. When a computer needs to get information from the internet, it can take a long time to get all of the information. Async and Defer help the computer to load the information faster.\n\nAsync stands for Asynchronous. Asynchronous means that the computer gets the information all at once, instead of loading one piece of information at a time. This way, the computer can get all of the information right away, without having to wait for each piece of the information to load. \n\nDefer stands for Deferred. Deferred means that the computer can start looking for the information, but it doesn't actually load it until it is needed. That way, the computer can start looking for the information while it is doing other things. When the information is needed, the computer can quickly load it instead of waiting for it to load before it can do something else. \n\nUsing Async or Defer can help a computer to get the information it needs faster. This means that things like websites and online games can be loaded faster so that you can use them faster. So, when a computer needs to get information, it can use Async and Defer to get it faster.",
